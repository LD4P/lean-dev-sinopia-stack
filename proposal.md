# Lean Development of the Sinopia Stack

In April, the LD4P's Sinopia project will release their first MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of a collaborative, cloud-based, linked data editor.  
This talk will explain the Lean Startup approach the Sinopia team took in building
the MVP in the first work-cycle following the Build-Measure-Learn 
methodology for agile software development. This talk will include material and concepts from Jeremy Nelson's book, 
Becoming a Lean Library, with specific examples and experiences from the Sinopia project as we measure usage and adoption of
Sinopia, and what we're learning for the next iterative work-cycle of Sinopia.
